	/*1)	(Telephone-Number Word Generator) 
	Standard telephone keypads contain the digits zero through nine. 
	The numbers two through nine each have three letters associated with them. 
	Many people find it difficult to memorize phone numbers, 
	so they use the correspondence between digits and letters to develop seven-letter 
	words that correspond to their phone numbers. 
	For example, a person whose telephone number is 686-2377 
	might use the correspondence indicated in below chart to develop 
	the seven-letter word “NUMBERS.” Every seven-letter word corresponds to 
	exactly one seven-digit telephone number. 
	A restaurant wishing to increase its takeout business could surely 
	do so with the number 825-3688 (i.e., “TAKEOUT”).
